# PutASocketInIt

## Installation

Ideally you should be running PutASocketInit (garbage tcp websockets) from ~~nothing at all~~ spawned Erlang processes. If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `put_a_socket_in_it` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:put_a_socket_in_it, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Otherwise try running me with `iex -S mix run`.
